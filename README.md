# usaco-algs
A compilation of some common algorithms/data structures and implementations used in USACO 

# Data Structures: 
  Binary Indexed Tree: implemented a structure, solves the Range Sum Query (RSQ) problem in O(log N) time. 
  Segment Tree: implemented in a structure, solves the Range Minimum Query (RMW) problem in O(log N) time. 
  
# Algorithms:
